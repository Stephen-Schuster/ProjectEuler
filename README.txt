Project Euler.
Here are my solutions to a bunch of problems on Project Euler. The first few problems are pretty easy,
but then they get really hard. If you don't know what Project Euler is, the tl;dr is it's a bunch of 
computer science problems. Here's an excerpt from their website too though:

"Project Euler is a series of challenging problems that require mathematical and programming skills."
