Project Euler.
Here are my solutions to a bunch of problems on Project Euler. The first few problems are pretty easy,
but then they get really hard. If you don't know what Project Euler is, the tl;dr is it's a bunch of 
computer science problems. Here's an excerpt from their website too though:

"Project Euler is a series of challenging problems that require mathematical and programming skills."

NOTE:
If you want to solve Project Euler problems, DO NOT PROCEDE. It will ruin the fun of finding the solution
on your own. This is only intended to be read by people who have already solved these problems or people
who don't think they ever plan on trying to solve them.
